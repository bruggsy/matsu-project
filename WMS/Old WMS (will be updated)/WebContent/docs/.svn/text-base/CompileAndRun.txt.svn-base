In order to get this WMS up and running, you will need to do a few things.

1) Know the directories of your source data.

2) Edit the WEB-INF/MatsuWMSConfig.xml to point to your data with unique layernames
and stylenames.

3) In the directory of the project, type ant to build the project.  This will result in
a file in the deploy directory called MatsuWMS.war.

4) There are a couple examples of web pages in overlay.html and multilayer.html.  Open
these and look inside to see how to add layers and where to get layers from.  The key
is to point to your local ip of this WMS for images from this WMS.  The layernames
and stylenames in the MatsuWMS.war need to show up in one of these files.

5) Put the MatsuWMS.war file in the webapps directory of tomcat and startup tomcat.
Now, point a browser to

If you are seeing images, good!
