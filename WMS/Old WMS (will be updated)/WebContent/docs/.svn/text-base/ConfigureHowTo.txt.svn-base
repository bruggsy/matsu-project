(At this point, we are at the very early stages of this WMS - it will get better)

Configuring the WMS to see cache directories

1) Without writing any of your own classes, you will need to adhere to the directory
structure in the CacheDirStructure.txt file.  It is not hard and it works.

2) Next, configure the MatsuWMSConfig.xml file to point to your directory of image files.
For example:
<wmsentry>
  <layername>TileLayer2</layername>
  <stylename>TileStyle2</stylename>
  <datatld>/devel/data/OCCCache/set2</datatld>
  <bounds>-180_-90_180_90</bounds>
</wmsentry>

This describes a data top level directory (datatld) to be at /devel/data/OCCCache/set2
and the layer and style that will access the files of the image set.  At this point,
the layername and stylename values must be unique.  I am not sure what duplicates in
the config will do right now.  Also, the bounds value is not used.
