This directory is only for the overall script which runs "the wheel."  It calls
run-wheel.sh file in the other directories.  Do not add any other files in this
directory.

The only files that belong here are run.sh and the master config file.  The only
setting we are including in the "master" config are global workfolow values,
such as the Accumulo config
